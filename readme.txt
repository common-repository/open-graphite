Control how your content is viewed when shared on social media.

== Description ==

Open Graphite lets you control how your WordPress content is viewed when shared on social media.

Typically when one of your pages is shared on social media (Facebook for example), the platform will use the first image and text it can find on the page. This is usually not ideal and often truncates the content into something nonsensical, resulting in the page being less likely to be engaged with.

Open Graphite solves this problem, by allowing you to customise the image, title and description of any of your pages that are shared on social media, all without compromising the original content.

== Installation ==

1) Go to 'Add New' plugins in WordPress admin
2) Search for 'Open Graphite'
3) Click 'Install Now' and wait for it to finish installing
4) Click 'Activate'

== How to use ==

For the homepage...

* Go to Open Graphite (admin side menu)
* Set your homepage title, description, image and object type
* Enter a Facebook app ID (optional)
* Enter a Twitter username (optional)
* Choose a Twitter card type
* Select which post types to enable for

For posts and pages...

* Create a new post or page (or edit an existing one)
* Scroll down to the Open Graphite metabox
* Enter your desired title, description, image and object type

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customise how each page or post is previewed when shared on social media? =

Yes. You can either set the option to automatically use the existing title, text (or excerpt) and image, or specify them manually on each page or post in the Open Graphite metabox.

= There appears to be duplicate sets of open graph tags =

Any other plug-in that inserts open graph tags into your website (Yoast is one that comes to mind) may conflict with Open Graphite to not work properly.

To test if you have a conflict, simply view the source code of your home page in your browser and search for any instances of og: within. Typically a plug-in will output the meta tags into it's own group. For this plug-in, they will be directly below the <code><!--/ Open Graphite /--></code> comment but other plug-ins will output something else (if at all). The only solution to resolve a conflict is to disable one of the plug-ins.

= Facebook isn't showing the correct information when I share my page or post =

Facebook (and possibly other social networks) will cache the open graph properties of a post that has previously been shared for up to 24 hours (maybe longer). During this time, any changes you make to your open graph properties will not be picked up by Facebook immediately. But there are a couple of solutions.

1) <a href="https://rocketapps.com.au/product/open-graphite-pro/" target="_blank">Upgrade to Pro</a> and get a Facebook Access Token, or...

2) Use the official <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/" target="_blank">Facebook Debugger</a>, paste in the URL of your page or post and hit the Debug button. When it has finished, hit the Scrape Again button. This will force Facebook to fetch the latest open graph data from your post. Twitter has a similar tool called the <a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator/" target="_blank">Card Validator</a> for this purpose as well.

Facebook might complain about the lack of an App ID when you pass your URL through their debugger, but this will not prevent anything from working correctly.

= Do I need a Facebook App ID? =

You don't need a Facebook App ID for this plugin to work. That said, there may be instances where having one is helpful. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app" target="_blank">Decide for yourself</a>. But if you plan on using the Facebook Access Token feature (highly recommended) then you will absolutely need a Facebook App ID.

= Will my current settings be inherited if I upgrade to pro? =

Yes. If you <a href="https://rocketapps.com.au/product/open-graphite-pro/" target="_blank">Upgrade to Pro</a> all your current configurations will be preserved.

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

Leave a message at the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/open-graphite/" target="_blank">plug-in support page</a>.
